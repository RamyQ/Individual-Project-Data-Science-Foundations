This project looks into historical features from big United States stock indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, Russell 2000, and NYSE Composite) and seeing if it can be used to effectively predict future market movements. I am interested in this topic because understanding the market is important in the business world and knowing how some features can be used to predict future prices. It also seems to be a challenging problem as it involves both time series analysis and learning more about neural networks.
